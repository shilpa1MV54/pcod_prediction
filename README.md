The project “PREDICTION OF POLYCYSTIC OVARY SYNDROME USING MACHINE LEARNING“, aims at designing and developing an automated system to detect and classify the Polycystic syndrome disease using MachineLearning.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) affects many women,making it a prevalent concern. It is a hormonal disorder that causes irregular, delayed, or absent menstrual cycles in the female body. 
This condition can lead to the development of type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes, weight gain, unwanted body hair, and various other complications. In severe cases,PCOS can result in infertility, posing a challenge for patients trying to conceive. Statistics show that the incidence rate of    PCOS has significantly increased in recent years, which is alarming.

If  PCOS is identified early, people may follow their doctor's recommendations live  a  better life. The dataset used for this research contains records for 541 patients. The aim of this study is to employ machine learning models to identify patterns in this disorder. 

The information learned is then inputted into various algorithms to assess accuracy,specificity,sensitivity, and precision using different ML models,such as Logistic Regression (LR) and Support VectorMachine (SVM) among others. The research utilized the Standard Scalar for feature selection and compared models to determine the most accurate one.
